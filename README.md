# ClientEmployeeSystem

Welcome to **ClientEmployeeSystem**! This is my first project as a CS student, built using WinForms and C#. The app features a user-friendly interface for managing client and employee data.

## Features
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy navigation through forms and panels.
- **Data Management**: Add, edit, and view client and employee information.
- **Simple Design**: Utilizes free design resources.

The main order menu is the hub for managing clients and employees, viewing records, and more.

## Note:
To run the app, you need Visual Studio with WinForms support.
